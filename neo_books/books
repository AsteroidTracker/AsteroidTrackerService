All of the mysteries physicists and cosmologists face—from the Big Bang to the future of the universe, from the puzzles of quantum physics to the unification of forces and particles—come down to the nature of time.\u003cBR\u003e\u003cBR\u003eThe fact that time is real may seem obvious. You experience it passing every day when you watch clocks tick, bread toast, and children grow. But most physicists, from Newton to Einstein to today’s quantum theorists, have seen things differently. The scientific case for time being an illusion is formidable. That is why the consequences of adopting the view that time is real are revolutionary.\u003cBR\u003e\u003cBR\u003eLee Smolin, author of the controversial bestseller \u003cI\u003eThe Trouble with Physics\u003c/I\u003e, argues that a limited notion of time is holding physics back. It’s time for a major revolution in scientific thought. The reality of time could be the key to the next big breakthrough in theoretical physics.\u003cBR\u003e\u003cBR\u003eWhat if the laws of physics themselves were not timeless? What if they could evolve? \u003cI\u003eTime Reborn\u003c/I\u003e offers a radical new approach to cosmology that embraces the reality of time and opens up a whole new universe of possibilities. There are few ideas that, like our notion of time, shape our thinking about literally everything, with huge implications for physics and beyond—from climate change to the economic crisis. Smolin explains in lively and lucid prose how the true nature of time impacts our world.\u003c/DIV\u003e"},{"asinItemID":"B00A2C53M6","title":"The Astronaut Wives Club: A True Story","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Koppel, Lily","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5139MmvmxOL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Astronaut-Wives-Club-Story-ebook/dp/B00A2C53M6%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00A2C53M6","description":"\u003cstrong\u003eWITH 50 EXCLUSIVE BONUS PHOTOS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e As America\u0027s Mercury Seven astronauts were launched on death-defying missions, television cameras focused on the brave smiles of their young wives.

Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human. How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you can’t walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, it’s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth.
