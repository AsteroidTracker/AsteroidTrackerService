        "description": "Bill Cooper, former United States Naval Intelligence Briefing Team member, reveals information that remains hidden from the public eye. This information has been kept in Top Secret government files since the 1940s. His audiences hear the truth unfold as he writes about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the war on drugs, the Secret Government and UFOs.<br /><br />Bill is a lucid, rational and powerful speaker who intent is to inform and to empower his audience. Standing room only is normal. His presentation and information transcend partisan affiliations as he clearly addresses issues in a way that has a striking impact on listeners of all backgrounds and interests. He has spoken to many groups throughout the United States and has appeared regularly on many radio talk shows and on television.<br /><br />In 1988 Bill decided to \"talk\" due to events then taking place worldwide, events which he had seen plans for back in the early '70s. Since Bill has been \"talking,\" he has correctly predicted the lowering of the Iron Curtain, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the invasion of Panama. All Bill's predictions were on record well before the events occurred. Bill is not a psychic. His information comes from Top Secret documents that he read while with the Intelligence Briefing Team and from over 17 years of thorough research. <br /><br />\"Bill Cooper is the world's leading expert on UFOs.\" — Billy Goodman, KVEG, Las Vegas. \"The onlt man in America who has all the pieces to the puzzle that has troubled so many for so long.\" — Anthony Hilder, Radio Free America<br /><br />\"William Cooper may be one of America's greatest heros, and this story may be the biggest story in the history of the world.\" — Mills Crenshaw, KTALK, Salt Lake City.<br /><br />\"Like it or not, everything is changing. The result will be the most wonderful experience in the history of man or the most horrible enslavement that you can imagine. Be active or abdicate, the future is in your hands.\" — William Cooper, October 24, 1989."

        "description": "#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER<br /><br />A landmark volume in science writing by one of the great minds of our time, Stephen Hawking’s book explores such profound questions as: How did the universe begin—and what made its start possible? Does time always flow forward? Is the universe unending—or are there boundaries? Are there other dimensions in space? What will happen when it all ends?<br /><br />Told in language we all can understand, <i>A Brief History of Time</i> plunges into the exotic realms of black holes and quarks, of antimatter and “arrows of time,” of the big bang and a bigger God—where the possibilities are wondrous and unexpected. With exciting images and profound imagination, Stephen Hawking brings us closer to the ultimate secrets at the very heart of creation."
