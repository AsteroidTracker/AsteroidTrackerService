Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human. How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you can’t walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, it’s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth. From the space shuttle training toilet to a crash test of NASA’s new space capsule (cadaver filling in for astronaut), Roach takes us on a surreally entertaining trip into the science of life in space and space on Earth."},{"asinItemID":"B00DQXTE2I","title":"Einstein\u0027s Cosmos: How Albert Einstein\u0027s Vision Transformed Our Understanding of Space and Time: Great Discoveries","productGroup":"Audible","author":"Michio Kaku","imageUri":"","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Einsteins-Cosmos-Transformed-Understanding-Discoveries/dp/B00DQXTE2I%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00DQXTE2I","description":" "},{"asinItemID":"B0000545OB","title":"A Brief History of Time","productGroup":"Audible","author":"Stephen Hawking","imageUri":"","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/A-Brief-History-of-Time/dp/B0000545OB%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0000545OB","description":" "},{"asinItemID":"B001P7GGRS","title":"The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Greene, Brian","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fVpAuurlL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Universe-Superstrings-Dimensions-ebook/dp/B001P7GGRS%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001P7GGRS","description":"\u003cp\u003eA new edition of the \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e bestseller—now a three-part \u003cem\u003eNova\u003c/em\u003e special: a fascinating and thought-provoking journey through the mysteries of space, time, and matter.\u003c/p\u003eNow with a new preface (not in any other edition) that will review the enormous public reception of the relatively obscure string theory—made possible by this book and an increased number of adherents amongst physicists—\u003cem\u003eThe Elegant Universe\u003c/em\u003e \"sets a standard that will be hard to beat\" (\u003cem\u003eNew York Times Book Review\u003c/em\u003e). Brian Greene, one of the world\u0027s leading string theorists, peels away the layers of mystery surrounding string theory to reveal a universe that consists of eleven dimensions, where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself, and all matter—from the smallest quarks to the most gargantuan supernovas—is generated by the vibrations of microscopically tiny loops of energy.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eToday physicists and mathematicians throughout the world are feverishly working on one of the most ambitious theories ever proposed: superstring theory. String theory, as it is often called, is the key to the Unified Field Theory that eluded Einstein for more than thirty years. Finally, the century-old antagonism between the large and the small-General Relativity and Quantum Theory-is resolved. String theory proclaims that all of the wondrous happenings in the universe, from the frantic dancing of subatomic quarks to the majestic swirling of heavenly galaxies, are reflections of one grand physical principle and manifestations of one single entity: microscopically tiny vibrating loops of energy, a billionth of a billionth the size of an atom. In this brilliantly articulated and refreshingly clear book, Greene relates the scientific story and the human struggle behind twentieth-century physics\u0027 search for a theory of everything.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThrough the masterful use of metaphor and analogy, \u003cem\u003eThe Elegant Universe\u003c/em\u003e makes some of the most sophisticated concepts ever contemplated viscerally accessible and thoroughly entertaining, bringing us closer than ever to understanding how the universe works."}]
