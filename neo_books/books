The last of these questions in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it’s the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues—such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives.\u003cP\u003e \u003cP\u003eNow, in a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science \u003cI\u003eis \u003c/I\u003eaddressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in \u003cI\u003eA Universe from Nothing, \u003c/I\u003eand they suggest that not only \u003cI\u003ecan \u003c/I\u003esomething arise from nothing, something will \u003cI\u003ealways \u003c/I\u003earise from nothing.\u003cP\u003e \u003cP\u003eWith his characteristic wry humor and wonderfully clear explanations, Krauss takes us back to the beginning of the beginning\u003cI\u003e, \u003c/I\u003epresenting the most recent evidence for how our universe evolved—and the implications for how it’s going to end. It will provoke, challenge, and delight readers as it looks at the most basic underpinnings of existence in a whole new way. And this knowledge that our universe will be quite different in the future from today has profound implications and directly affects how we live in the present. As Richard Dawkins has described it: This could potentially be the most important scientific book with implications for supernaturalism since Darwin.\u003cP\u003e \u003cP\u003eA fascinating antidote to outmoded philosophical and religious thinking, \u003cI\u003eA Universe from Nothing \u003c/I\u003eis a provocative, game-changing entry into the debate about the existence of God and everything that exists. “Forget Jesus,” Krauss has argued, “the stars died so you could be born.”"},{"asinItemID":"B007HXL016","title":"Why Does the World Exist?: An Existential Detective Story","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Holt, Jim","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51b2RCzJfLL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Why-Does-World-Exist-ebook/dp/B007HXL016%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB007HXL016","description":"\u003cp\u003eIn this astonishing and profound work, an irreverent sleuth traces the riddle of existence from the ancient world to modern times.\u003c/p\u003eWhether framedphilosophically as “Why is there a world rather than nothing at all?” or morecolloquially as “But, Mommy, who made God?” the metaphysical mystery about howwe came into existence remains the most fractious and fascinating question ofall time.

Brian Greene, one of the world\u0027s leading string theorists, peels away the layers of mystery surrounding string theory to reveal a universe that consists of eleven dimensions, where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself, and all matter—from the smallest quarks to the most gargantuan supernovas—is generated by the vibrations of microscopically tiny loops of energy.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eToday physicists and mathematicians throughout the world are feverishly working on one of the most ambitious theories ever proposed: superstring theory. String theory, as it is often called, is the key to the Unified Field Theory that eluded Einstein for more than thirty years. Finally, the century-old antagonism between the large and the small-General Relativity and Quantum Theory-is resolved. String theory proclaims that all of the wondrous happenings in the universe, from the frantic dancing of subatomic quarks to the majestic swirling of heavenly galaxies, are reflections of one grand physical principle and manifestations of one single entity: microscopically tiny vibrating loops of energy, a billionth of a billionth the size of an atom.
