All of the mysteries physicists and cosmologists face—from the Big Bang to the future of the universe, from the puzzles of quantum physics to the unification of forces and particles—come down to the nature of time.\u003cBR\u003e\u003cBR\u003eThe fact that time is real may seem obvious. You experience it passing every day when you watch clocks tick, bread toast, and children grow. But most physicists, from Newton to Einstein to today’s quantum theorists, have seen things differently. The scientific case for time being an illusion is formidable. That is why the consequences of adopting the view that time is real are revolutionary.\u003cBR\u003e\u003cBR\u003eLee Smolin, author of the controversial bestseller \u003cI\u003eThe Trouble with Physics\u003c/I\u003e, argues that a limited notion of time is holding physics back.

Even knowing the complexity and risk involved in Shuttle operations, I was shocked by the news. The shuttle commander, Dick Scobee, had been an Air Force test pilot at Edwards and flown a number of research missions at NASA Dryden. I grieved for all the crew, but especially Dick, who I knew best. I can still recall his broad grin when he visited the Dryden pilot\u0027s office following the announcement of his selection as an astronaut. He showed great pride in his selection, and I congratulated him heartily. The results of the accident review board were hard to accept. The commission that investigated the accident blamed the Shuttle loss on poor management decisions. Challenger had been launched against the recommendations of knowledgeable technical personnel who insisted that low temperatures that day increased the chance of hot gas leakage around the seals of the solid rocket boosters. The commission found that the decision making process leading to the launch was flawed and that launch temperature constraints were waived at the expense of flight safety. It was a black day for NASA. I could sense a change in people\u0027s attitude concerning the space program. After the Challenger accident report was released, the public\u0027s pride in and respect for NASA diminished. At Dryden, we had always striven not to allow the desire to \"get a flight off\" to interfere with good judgment on flight safety. It was a cardinal rule. There were occasions when visiting Headquarters personnel and other VIPs were on hand to witness a test flight and we had to cancel the event due to some technical problem. We forced ourselves to avoid the desire to \"press on\" just to meet a schedule or impress a visiting VIP.\""},{"asinItemID":"B000XPPVCY","title":"Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Tyson, Neil deGrasse","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DcXg1EGsL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Death-Black-Hole-Quandaries-ebook/dp/B000XPPVCY%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000XPPVCY","description":"\u003cp\u003e“One of today’s best popularizers of                     science.”—\u003cem\u003eKirkus  Reviews\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003eLoyal readers of the monthly “Universe” essays in            \u003cem\u003eNatural History\u003c/em\u003e magazine have long recognized                     Neil deGrasse Tyson’s talent for guiding them  through the mysteries of the cosmos with                 stunning clarity and childlike  enthusiasm.
