It took five  years for von Daniken to document, on film, the physical evidence of visits  by galactic travelers who came to Earth. Just what they did here and the  influences they left behind is the core of the film. In search of basic  truths, the film, CHARIOTS OF THE GODS, takes the viewer into the far  reaches of underground caves and tombs, and to the tops of desolate  mountains on every major continent to show the evidence von Daniken has  been collecting. Although this controversial film may provide the answers  to age old mysteries, it may be the beginning of an entirely new set of  questions. \u003cb\u003e Bonus Features: \u003c/b\u003e Scene Selection, Photo Gallery, Bio on  Erich von Daniken, Trailer. \u003cb\u003e Specs: \u003c/b\u003e DVD5; Dolby Digital Mono; 90  minutes; Color; 1.33:1 Aspect Ratio; MPAA - G; Year - 1972."},{"asinItemID":"B003YJEXUM","title":"Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Roach, Mary","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mjYI8M9sL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Packing-Mars-Curious-Science-ebook/dp/B003YJEXUM%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB003YJEXUM","description":"\u003cp\u003e“America’s funniest science writer” (\u003cem\u003eWashington Post\u003c/em\u003e) returns to explore the irresistibly strange universe of life without gravity in this \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e bestseller.\u003c/p\u003eSpace is a world devoid of the things we need to live and thrive: air, gravity, hot showers, fresh produce, privacy, beer. Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human. How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you can’t walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, it’s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth. From the space shuttle training toilet to a crash test of NASA’s new space capsule (cadaver filling in for astronaut), Roach takes us on a surreally entertaining trip into the science of life in space and space on Earth."}]
