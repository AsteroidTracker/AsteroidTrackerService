Access to texts such as the Book of Enoch, the Nag Hamadi Gospels, the Book of Jubilees, among other historical scripts, when synthesized and correlated with existing documents, is truly an eye opener relative to the common beliefs found in the modern Western culture.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e     The \"Anunnaki of Nibiru\" takes the reader on a profound belief-challenging journey through ancient mesopotamia and Sumer.  This book is not like any other in the field:  expect the the winged-warrior aerial perspective of a helicopter pilot, the BS filter of a seasoned electronics design engineer, a Western medicine-challenging Structural Integrator,  and Southern California didgeridoo player and designer all at the same time.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e     Western history, taught in today\u0027s U.S. public schools,  begins in Greece, although to be true to history, it should start in Mesopotamia with the Sumerians, accredited with all aspects of a modern civilization, influencing both Egypt and Greece alike.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e     Television series produced by the History Channel, like the Ancient Aliens Series, appears to be assisting the masses in waking up to the fact that the Anunnaki were not a myth, having left physical documents and artifacts backing up their claims to have created mankind, described in highly sophisticated language, as recorded by Atrahasis. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e     It was in South Africa, where the idea was spawned to create a primitive worker, namely mankind, to operate the gold mines, provide temple building manpower, and generally serve every whim the Ancient Astronauts from Nibiru conceived of.   Many of the Niburians, referenced in the Biblical Genesis as the Elohim, known the the Sumerians as the Anunnaki, were enthroned as gods in Mesopotamia.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e     Perhaps it is fitting for Westerners to look into the religious and historical origins for the kings and demigods of Sumer, the first culture to provide evidence of the cuneiform script language, complete with no antecedent.  Not only were mundane records, detailed as they were, kept on clay tablets, tens of thousands of which survive to this day, but the history and direct experience accounts of some of the famed inhabitants, like king Gilgamesh of Uruk, introduce us to \"Those who from Heaven to Earth Came.\"  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e     The Great Anunna were ancient astronauts hailing from a planet in our own solar system, whose apogee resides in a 3,600 retrograde elliptical orbit beyond Pluto.  According to their records, likely using spectroscopy as scientists do today, they located gold and petroleum, both necessary resources for them on planet earth.  Due to a failing atmosphere on Nibiru, Anu their king dispatched his pre-eminent scientist and first-born son, Enki, on a space mission to Earth to recover enough gold that could be ionized in a layer of their atmosphere, as a solar radiation shield.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e     The mines that were described in South Africa have been found and carbon dated, indicating that they were in operation at the exact time and location that the \"Genetic Eve Study\" indicates: womankind\u0027s genetic origins have been located near Enki\u0027s gold mining operating along the Zambezi river, Africa.  Michael Tellinger followed the Sumerian account to Africa, locating many of the mines, homes and temples used by the primitive workers and gods, our true ancestors.  Igigi slaves initially worked the gold mines before revolting, while serving their Anunnaki masters as recorded in the cuneiform tablets like the Atrahasis and the Epic of Gilgamesh.    \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e     Additional source material is included in the Bibliography and Appendix for the reader to explore.  Now consider your place in the unfolding New World Order.  Will you choose the Enlilites or Enkiites to affiliate with, or do you have a choice?  Enjoy this intellectual read, it is mind-bending, pineal-gland stimulating, and worth it!"},{"asinItemID":"B0000U7N00","title":"A Short History of Nearly Everything","productGroup":"Audible","author":"Bill Bryson","imageUri":"","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Nearly-Everything/dp/B0000U7N00%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0000U7N00","description":" "},{"asinItemID":"B004WY3D0O","title":"A Brief History of Time","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Hawking, Stephen","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rWHai4EUL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Time-ebook/dp/B004WY3D0O%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB004WY3D0O","description":"#1 \u003ci\u003eNEW YORK TIMES\u003c/i\u003e BESTSELLER\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA landmark volume in science writing by one of the great minds of our time, Stephen Hawking’s book explores such profound questions as: How did the universe begin—and what made its start possible?
