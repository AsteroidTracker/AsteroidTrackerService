You experience it passing every day when you watch clocks tick, bread toast, and children grow.

That is why the consequences of adopting the view that time is real are revolutionary.\u003cBR\u003e\u003cBR\u003eLee Smolin, author of the controversial bestseller \u003cI\u003eThe Trouble with Physics\u003c/I\u003e, argues that a limited notion of time is holding physics back.

This runaway bestseller, which has captured the imagination of critics and the public alike, traces our latest efforts to grasp the origins of the universe.

What followed next began a life time of abductions by these strange alien beings. \u003cbr /\u003eIn Children Of The Greys, a true story of his numerous alien encounters, author Bret Oldham relives many of these traumatic alien abduction experiences. From mind control experiments, sexual interludes, healings, unexplainable scars, hybrids, an incredible multiple abduction with another witness and a fetus being taken, to the paranormal connection and more; all described in great detail. Theories and insights into the possible alien agenda by some of the world\u0027s leading UFO and alien abduction experts are also presented here. Memories that had been suppressed for years by the aliens surfaced after receiving therapy for a series of anxiety attacks. Memories that were kept secret for decades are now revealed for the first time in this very personal, thought provoking account of one man\u0027s journey through the enigma of the alien abduction phenomena."},{"asinItemID":"B004T4KQJS","title":"A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Krauss, Lawrence","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517V1E2J-zL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Universe-Nothing-Something-Rather-ebook/dp/B004T4KQJS%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB004T4KQJS","description":"\u003cB\u003e“WHERE DID THE UNIVERSE COME FROM?

The last of these questions in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it’s the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues—such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives.\u003cP\u003e \u003cP\u003eNow, in a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads.

It will provoke, challenge, and delight readers as it looks at the most basic underpinnings of existence in a whole new way.

What happens to you when you can’t walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, it’s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth. From the space shuttle training toilet to a crash test of NASA’s new space capsule (cadaver filling in for astronaut), Roach takes us on a surreally entertaining trip into the science of life in space and space on Earth."}]
