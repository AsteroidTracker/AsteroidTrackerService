Following in the footsteps of Christopher Hitchens, Roger Penrose,and even Stephen Hawking, Jim Holt emerges with an engrossing narrative thattraces our latest efforts to grasp the origins of the universe. As he takes onthe role of cosmological detective, the brilliant yet slyly humorous Holtcontends that we might have been too narrow in limiting our suspects to God vs.the Big Bang. Whether interviewing a cranky Oxford philosopher, a Physics NobelLaureate, or a French Buddhist monk, Holt pursues unexplored and often bizarreangles to this cosmic puzzle. The result is a brilliant synthesis of cosmology,mathematics, and physics—one that propels his own work to the level ofphilosophy itself."},{"asinItemID":"B008SQL6NS","title":"Mind and Cosmos:Why the Materialist Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature Is Almost Certainly False","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Nagel, Thomas","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rYpRhhLHL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Cosmos-Materialist-Neo-Darwinian-ebook/dp/B008SQL6NS%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB008SQL6NS","description":"The modern materialist approach to life has conspicuously failed to explain such central mind-related features of our world as consciousness, intentionality, meaning, and value. This failure to account for something so integral to nature as mind, argues philosopher Thomas Nagel, is a major problem, threatening to unravel the entire naturalistic world picture, extending to biology, evolutionary theory, and cosmology.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSince minds are features of biological systems that have developed through evolution, the standard materialist version of evolutionary biology is fundamentally incomplete.  And the cosmological history that led to the origin of life and the coming into existence of the conditions for evolution cannot be a merely materialist history, either.  An adequate conception of nature would have to explain the appearance in the universe of materially irreducible conscious minds, as such.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNagel\u0027s skepticism is not based on religious belief or on a belief in any definite alternative. In \u003cem\u003eMind and Cosmos\u003c/em\u003e, he does suggest that if the materialist account is wrong,  then principles of a different kind may also be at work in the history of nature, principles of the growth of order that are in their logical form teleological rather than mechanistic.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn spite of the great achievements of the physical sciences, reductive materialism is a world view ripe for displacement. Nagel shows that to recognize its limits is the first step in looking for alternatives, or at least in being open to their possibility."},{"asinItemID":"B004T4KQJS","title":"A Universe from Nothing","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Krauss, Lawrence","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517V1E2J-zL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/A-Universe-from-Nothing-ebook/dp/B004T4KQJS%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB004T4KQJS","description":"\u003cB\u003e“WHERE DID THE UNIVERSE COME FROM?

The last of these questions in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it’s the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God.

It will provoke, challenge, and delight readers as it looks at the most basic underpinnings of existence in a whole new way.
