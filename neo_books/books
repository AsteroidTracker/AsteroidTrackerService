Though his theory could explain many facts, Darwin knew that there was a significant event in the history of life that his theory did not explain. During this event, the “Cambrian explosion,” many animals suddenly appeared in the fossil record without apparent ancestors in earlier layers of rock.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eDarwin’s Doubt\u003c/em\u003e, Stephen C. Meyer tells the story of the mystery surrounding this explosion of animal life—a mystery that has intensified, not only because the expected ancestors of these animals have not been found, but because scientists have learned more about what it takes to construct an animal. During the last half century, biologists have come to appreciate the central importance of biological information—stored in DNA and elsewhere in cells—to building animal forms.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eExpanding on the compelling case he presented in his last book, \u003cem\u003eSignature in the Cell\u003c/em\u003e, Meyer argues that the origin of this information, as well as other mysterious features of the Cambrian event, are best explained by intelligent design, rather than purely undirected evolutionary processes.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"asinItemID":"B0000U7N00","title":"A Short History of Nearly Everything","productGroup":"Audible","author":"Bill Bryson","imageUri":"","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Nearly-Everything/dp/B0000U7N00%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0000U7N00","description":" "},{"asinItemID":"B006XXVJI0","title":"The Smell of Kerosene: A Test Pilot\u0027s Odyssey - NASA Research Pilot Stories, XB-70 Tragic Collision, M2-F1 Lifting Body, YF-12 Blackbird, Apollo LLRV Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (NASA SP-4108)","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Peter W.

This book puts the reader in the pilot\u0027s seat for a \"day at the office\" unlike any other. It recounts the tragic 1966 mid-air collision with the XB-70; describes flights of the lifting body and YF-12 blackbird, and details work with the Apollo Lunar Landing Research Vehicle.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe Smell of Kerosene tells the dramatic story of a NASA research pilot who logged over 11,000 flight hours in more than 125 types of aircraft. Donald Mallick gives the reader fascinating firsthand descriptions of his early naval flight training, carrier operations, and his research flying career with NASA and its predecessor agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMallick joined the NACA as a research pilot at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory at Hampton, Virginia, where he flew modified helicopters and jets, and witnessed the NACA\u0027s evolution into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAfter transferring to the NASA Flight Research Center (now NASA Dryden Flight Research Center) at Edwards, California, he became involved with projects that further pushed the boundaries of aerospace technology. These included the giant delta-winged XB-70 supersonic research airplane, the wingless M2-F1 lifting body vehicle, and the triple-sonic YF-12 Blackbird. Mallick also test flew the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV) and helped develop techniques used in training astronauts to land on the Moon.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eExcerpt: \" I was onboard an airliner, on 28 January 1986, when I heard the news that the Space Shuttle Challenger had exploded 73 seconds after launch that morning. Even knowing the complexity and risk involved in Shuttle operations, I was shocked by the news. The shuttle commander, Dick Scobee, had been an Air Force test pilot at Edwards and flown a number of research missions at NASA Dryden. I grieved for all the crew, but especially Dick, who I knew best. I can still recall his broad grin when he visited the Dryden pilot\u0027s office following the announcement of his selection as an astronaut. He showed great pride in his selection, and I congratulated him heartily. The results of the accident review board were hard to accept. The commission that investigated the accident blamed the Shuttle loss on poor management decisions. Challenger had been launched against the recommendations of knowledgeable technical personnel who insisted that low temperatures that day increased the chance of hot gas leakage around the seals of the solid rocket boosters. The commission found that the decision making process leading to the launch was flawed and that launch temperature constraints were waived at the expense of flight safety. It was a black day for NASA. I could sense a change in people\u0027s attitude concerning the space program. After the Challenger accident report was released, the public\u0027s pride in and respect for NASA diminished. At Dryden, we had always striven not to allow the desire to \"get a flight off\" to interfere with good judgment on flight safety. It was a cardinal rule. There were occasions when visiting Headquarters personnel and other VIPs were on hand to witness a test flight and we had to cancel the event due to some technical problem. We forced ourselves to avoid the desire to \"press on\" just to meet a schedule or impress a visiting VIP.\""},{"asinItemID":"B003YJEXUM","title":"Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Roach, Mary","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mjYI8M9sL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Packing-Mars-Curious-Science-ebook/dp/B003YJEXUM%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB003YJEXUM","description":"\u003cp\u003e“America’s funniest science writer” (\u003cem\u003eWashington Post\u003c/em\u003e) returns to explore the irresistibly strange universe of life without gravity in this \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e bestseller.\u003c/p\u003eSpace is a world devoid of the things we need to live and thrive: air, gravity, hot showers, fresh produce, privacy, beer. Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human. How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you can’t walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, it’s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth. From the space shuttle training toilet to a crash test of NASA’s new space capsule (cadaver filling in for astronaut), Roach takes us on a surreally entertaining trip into the science of life in space and space on Earth."},{"asinItemID":"B004WY3D0O","title":"A Brief History of Time","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Hawking, Stephen","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rWHai4EUL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Time-ebook/dp/B004WY3D0O%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB004WY3D0O","description":"#1 \u003ci\u003eNEW YORK TIMES\u003c/i\u003e BESTSELLER\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA landmark volume in science writing by one of the great minds of our time, Stephen Hawking’s book explores such profound questions as: How did the universe begin—and what made its start possible?
