AND FINALLY, WHY IS THERE SOMETHING RATHER THAN NOTHING?”\u003c/B\u003e\u003cP\u003e \u003cP\u003eNow with color illustrations throughout.\u003cP\u003e \u003cP\u003eLawrence Krauss’s provocative answers to these and other timeless questions in a wildly popular lecture now on YouTube have attracted almost a million viewers. The last of these questions in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it’s the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues—such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives.\u003cP\u003e \u003cP\u003eNow, in a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science \u003cI\u003eis \u003c/I\u003eaddressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in \u003cI\u003eA Universe from Nothing, \u003c/I\u003eand they suggest that not only \u003cI\u003ecan \u003c/I\u003esomething arise from nothing, something will \u003cI\u003ealways \u003c/I\u003earise from nothing.\u003cP\u003e \u003cP\u003eWith his characteristic wry humor and wonderfully clear explanations, Krauss takes us back to the beginning of the beginning\u003cI\u003e, \u003c/I\u003epresenting the most recent evidence for how our universe evolved—and the implications for how it’s going to end. It will provoke, challenge, and delight readers as it looks at the most basic underpinnings of existence in a whole new way. And this knowledge that our universe will be quite different in the future from today has profound implications and directly affects how we live in the present. As Richard Dawkins has described it: This could potentially be the most important scientific book with implications for supernaturalism since Darwin.\u003cP\u003e \u003cP\u003eA fascinating antidote to outmoded philosophical and religious thinking, \u003cI\u003eA Universe from Nothing \u003c/I\u003eis a provocative, game-changing entry into the debate about the existence of God and everything that exists. “Forget Jesus,” Krauss has argued, “the stars died so you could be born.”"},{"asinItemID":"B003YJEXUM","title":"Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Roach, Mary","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mjYI8M9sL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Packing-Mars-Curious-Science-ebook/dp/B003YJEXUM%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB003YJEXUM","description":"\u003cp\u003e“America’s funniest science writer” (\u003cem\u003eWashington Post\u003c/em\u003e) returns to explore the irresistibly strange universe of life without gravity in this \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e bestseller.\u003c/p\u003eSpace is a world devoid of the things we need to live and thrive: air, gravity, hot showers, fresh produce, privacy, beer.

Donald Mallick gives the reader fascinating firsthand descriptions of his early naval flight training, carrier operations, and his research flying career with NASA and its predecessor agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMallick joined the NACA as a research pilot at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory at Hampton, Virginia, where he flew modified helicopters and jets, and witnessed the NACA\u0027s evolution into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAfter transferring to the NASA Flight Research Center (now NASA Dryden Flight Research Center) at Edwards, California, he became involved with projects that further pushed the boundaries of aerospace technology. These included the giant delta-winged XB-70 supersonic research airplane, the wingless M2-F1 lifting body vehicle, and the triple-sonic YF-12 Blackbird. Mallick also test flew the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV) and helped develop techniques used in training astronauts to land on the Moon.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eExcerpt: \" I was onboard an airliner, on 28 January 1986, when I heard the news that the Space Shuttle Challenger had exploded 73 seconds after launch that morning. Even knowing the complexity and risk involved in Shuttle operations, I was shocked by the news. The shuttle commander, Dick Scobee, had been an Air Force test pilot at Edwards and flown a number of research missions at NASA Dryden. I grieved for all the crew, but especially Dick, who I knew best. I can still recall his broad grin when he visited the Dryden pilot\u0027s office following the announcement of his selection as an astronaut. He showed great pride in his selection, and I congratulated him heartily. The results of the accident review board were hard to accept. The commission that investigated the accident blamed the Shuttle loss on poor management decisions. Challenger had been launched against the recommendations of knowledgeable technical personnel who insisted that low temperatures that day increased the chance of hot gas leakage around the seals of the solid rocket boosters. The commission found that the decision making process leading to the launch was flawed and that launch temperature constraints were waived at the expense of flight safety. It was a black day for NASA. I could sense a change in people\u0027s attitude concerning the space program. After the Challenger accident report was released, the public\u0027s pride in and respect for NASA diminished. At Dryden, we had always striven not to allow the desire to \"get a flight off\" to interfere with good judgment on flight safety. It was a cardinal rule. There were occasions when visiting Headquarters personnel and other VIPs were on hand to witness a test flight and we had to cancel the event due to some technical problem. We forced ourselves to avoid the desire to \"press on\" just to meet a schedule or impress a visiting VIP.\""},{"asinItemID":"B003TXSF5C","title":"The Grand Design","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Mlodinow, Leonard","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UfvNQsMgL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/The-Grand-Design-ebook/dp/B003TXSF5C%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB003TXSF5C","description":"\u003cb\u003e#1 \u003ci\u003eNEW YORK TIMES\u003c/i\u003e BESTSELLER\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen  and how did the universe begin?
