Why does nature need them? What use are they?Neutrinos are                perhaps the most enigmatic particles in the universe. Formed in certain radioactive                decays, they pass through most matter with ease. These tiny, ghostly particles are                formed in millions in the Sun and pass through us constantly. For a long time they                were thought to be massless, and passing as they do like ghosts they were not                regarded as significant. Now we know they have a very small mass, and there are                strong indications that they are very important indeed. It is speculated thata heavy                form of neutrino, that is both matter and antimatter, may have shaped the balance of                matter and antimatter in the early universe.Here, Frank Close gives an account of                the discovery of neutrinos and our growing understanding of their significance, also                touching on some speculative ideas concerning the possible uses of neutrinos and                their role in the early universe."}]
