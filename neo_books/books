As he moves from our very molecular composition (a result of stellar events at the origin of our solar system) through the workings of our eyes, Shubin makes clear how the evolution of the cosmos has profoundly marked our own bodies.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"asinItemID":"0929385225","title":"Behold a Pale Horse","productGroup":"Book","author":"Milton William Cooper","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GiIuiGJWL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Behold-Horse-Milton-William-Cooper/dp/0929385225%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0929385225","description":"The author, former U.S. Naval Intelligence Briefing Team Member, reveals information kept secret by our government since the 1940s.
