Though his theory could explain many facts, Darwin knew that there was a significant event in the history of life that his theory did not explain. During this event, the “Cambrian explosion,” many animals suddenly appeared in the fossil record without apparent ancestors in earlier layers of rock.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eDarwin’s Doubt\u003c/em\u003e, Stephen C. Meyer tells the story of the mystery surrounding this explosion of animal life—a mystery that has intensified, not only because the expected ancestors of these animals have not been found, but because scientists have learned more about what it takes to construct an animal. During the last half century, biologists have come to appreciate the central importance of biological information—stored in DNA and elsewhere in cells—to building animal forms.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eExpanding on the compelling case he presented in his last book, \u003cem\u003eSignature in the Cell\u003c/em\u003e, Meyer argues that the origin of this information, as well as other mysterious features of the Cambrian event, are best explained by intelligent design, rather than purely undirected evolutionary processes.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"asinItemID":"B007HXL016","title":"Why Does the World Exist?: An Existential Detective Story","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Holt, Jim","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WKrErY6KL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Why-Does-World-Exist-ebook/dp/B007HXL016%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB007HXL016","description":"\u003cp\u003e“I can imagine few more enjoyable ways of thinking than to read this book.”—Sarah Bakewell, \u003cem\u003eNew York Times \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eBook Review\u003c/em\u003e, front-page review\u003c/p\u003eTackling the “darkest question in all of philosophy” with “raffish erudition” (Dwight Garner, \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e), author Jim Holt explores the greatest metaphysical mystery of all: why is there something rather than nothing? This runaway bestseller, which has captured the imagination of critics and the public alike, traces our latest efforts to grasp the origins of the universe. Holt adopts the role of cosmological detective, traveling the globe to interview a host of celebrated scientists, philosophers, and writers, “testing the contentions of one against the theories of the other” (Jeremy Bernstein, \u003cem\u003eWall Street Journal\u003c/em\u003e). As he interrogates his list of ontological culprits, the brilliant yet slyly humorous Holt contends that we might have been too narrow in limiting our suspects to God versus the Big Bang. This “deft and consuming” (David Ulin, \u003cem\u003eLos Angeles Times\u003c/em\u003e) narrative humanizes the profound questions of meaning and existence it confronts."}]
