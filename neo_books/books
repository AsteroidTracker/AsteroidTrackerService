Though his theory could explain many facts, Darwin knew that there was a significant event in the history of life that his theory did not explain. During this event, the “Cambrian explosion,” many animals suddenly appeared in the fossil record without apparent ancestors in earlier layers of rock.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eDarwin’s Doubt\u003c/em\u003e, Stephen C. Meyer tells the story of the mystery surrounding this explosion of animal life—a mystery that has intensified, not only because the expected ancestors of these animals have not been found, but because scientists have learned more about what it takes to construct an animal. During the last half century, biologists have come to appreciate the central importance of biological information—stored in DNA and elsewhere in cells—to building animal forms.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eExpanding on the compelling case he presented in his last book, \u003cem\u003eSignature in the Cell\u003c/em\u003e, Meyer argues that the origin of this information, as well as other mysterious features of the Cambrian event, are best explained by intelligent design, rather than purely undirected evolutionary processes.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"asinItemID":"B003YJEXUM","title":"Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Roach, Mary","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mjYI8M9sL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Packing-Mars-Curious-Science-ebook/dp/B003YJEXUM%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB003YJEXUM","description":"\u003cp\u003e“America’s funniest science writer” (\u003cem\u003eWashington Post\u003c/em\u003e) returns to explore the irresistibly strange universe of life without gravity in this \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e bestseller.\u003c/p\u003eSpace is a world devoid of the things we need to live and thrive: air, gravity, hot showers, fresh produce, privacy, beer. Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human. How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you can’t walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, it’s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth. From the space shuttle training toilet to a crash test of NASA’s new space capsule (cadaver filling in for astronaut), Roach takes us on a surreally entertaining trip into the science of life in space and space on Earth."},{"asinItemID":"B004WY3D0O","title":"A Brief History of Time","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Hawking, Stephen","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rWHai4EUL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Time-ebook/dp/B004WY3D0O%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB004WY3D0O","description":"#1 \u003ci\u003eNEW YORK TIMES\u003c/i\u003e BESTSELLER\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA landmark volume in science writing by one of the great minds of our time, Stephen Hawking’s book explores such profound questions as: How did the universe begin—and what made its start possible?
