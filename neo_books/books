Though his theory could explain many facts, Darwin knew that there was a significant event in the history of life that his theory did not explain. During this event, the “Cambrian explosion,” many animals suddenly appeared in the fossil record without apparent ancestors in earlier layers of rock.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eDarwin’s Doubt\u003c/em\u003e, Stephen C. Meyer tells the story of the mystery surrounding this explosion of animal life—a mystery that has intensified, not only because the expected ancestors of these animals have not been found, but because scientists have learned more about what it takes to construct an animal. During the last half century, biologists have come to appreciate the central importance of biological information—stored in DNA and elsewhere in cells—to building animal forms.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eExpanding on the compelling case he presented in his last book, \u003cem\u003eSignature in the Cell\u003c/em\u003e, Meyer argues that the origin of this information, as well as other mysterious features of the Cambrian event, are best explained by intelligent design, rather than purely undirected evolutionary processes.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"asinItemID":"B004ZELPS8","title":"Mission to Berlin: The American Airmen Who Struck the Heart of Hitler\u0027s Reich","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Dorr, Robert F.","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wIG9K7VmL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Mission-Berlin-American-Hitlers-ebook/dp/B004ZELPS8%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB004ZELPS8","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cDIV\u003eFrom \u003ci\u003eHell Hawks! \u003c/i\u003eauthor Bob Dorr, \u003ci\u003eMission  to Berlin\u003c/i\u003e takes the reader on a World War II strategic bombing  mission from an airfield in East Anglia, England, to Berlin and back.

He has spoken to many groups throughout the United States and has appeared regularly on many radio talk shows and on television.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn 1988 Bill decided to \"talk\" due to events then taking place worldwide, events which he had seen plans for back in the early \u002770s.

All Bill\u0027s predictions were on record well before the events occurred. Bill is not a psychic.

Here                  Tyson compiles his favorite essays across a myriad of cosmic topics. The title essay                introduces readers to the physics  of black holes                by explaining just what would happen to your body                if  you fell into one, while “Hollywood Nights”           assails Hollywood’s feeble efforts to  get its                  night skies right.  Tyson is the world’s  best-known astrophysicist, and he’s at his best               here, as a natural teacher who  simplifies the                    complexities  of astrophysics while sharing his    infectious excitement for our universe."}]
