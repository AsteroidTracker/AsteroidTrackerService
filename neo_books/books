As he pulls the curtains back to look for the cause of the strange light, he comes face to face with a hideous looking alien creature. What followed next began a life time of abductions by these strange alien beings. \u003cbr /\u003eIn Children Of The Greys, a true story of his numerous alien encounters, author Bret Oldham relives many of these traumatic alien abduction experiences. From mind control experiments, sexual interludes, healings, unexplainable scars, hybrids, an incredible multiple abduction with another witness and a fetus being taken, to the paranormal connection and more; all described in great detail. Theories and insights into the possible alien agenda by some of the world\u0027s leading UFO and alien abduction experts are also presented here. Memories that had been suppressed for years by the aliens surfaced after receiving therapy for a series of anxiety attacks. Memories that were kept secret for decades are now revealed for the first time in this very personal, thought provoking account of one man\u0027s journey through the enigma of the alien abduction phenomena."},{"asinItemID":"B004WY3D0O","title":"A Brief History of Time","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Hawking, Stephen","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rWHai4EUL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Time-ebook/dp/B004WY3D0O%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB004WY3D0O","description":"#1 \u003ci\u003eNEW YORK TIMES\u003c/i\u003e BESTSELLER\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA landmark volume in science writing by one of the great minds of our time, Stephen Hawking’s book explores such profound questions as: How did the universe begin—and what made its start possible?

Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human. How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you can’t walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, it’s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth.

This book puts the reader in the pilot\u0027s seat for a \"day at the office\" unlike any other. It recounts the tragic 1966 mid-air collision with the XB-70; describes flights of the lifting body and YF-12 blackbird, and details work with the Apollo Lunar Landing Research Vehicle.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe Smell of Kerosene tells the dramatic story of a NASA research pilot who logged over 11,000 flight hours in more than 125 types of aircraft. Donald Mallick gives the reader fascinating firsthand descriptions of his early naval flight training, carrier operations, and his research flying career with NASA and its predecessor agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMallick joined the NACA as a research pilot at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory at Hampton, Virginia, where he flew modified helicopters and jets, and witnessed the NACA\u0027s evolution into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAfter transferring to the NASA Flight Research Center (now NASA Dryden Flight Research Center) at Edwards, California, he became involved with projects that further pushed the boundaries of aerospace technology. These included the giant delta-winged XB-70 supersonic research airplane, the wingless M2-F1 lifting body vehicle, and the triple-sonic YF-12 Blackbird. Mallick also test flew the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV) and helped develop techniques used in training astronauts to land on the Moon.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eExcerpt: \" I was onboard an airliner, on 28 January 1986, when I heard the news that the Space Shuttle Challenger had exploded 73 seconds after launch that morning. Even knowing the complexity and risk involved in Shuttle operations, I was shocked by the news. The shuttle commander, Dick Scobee, had been an Air Force test pilot at Edwards and flown a number of research missions at NASA Dryden. I grieved for all the crew, but especially Dick, who I knew best. I can still recall his broad grin when he visited the Dryden pilot\u0027s office following the announcement of his selection as an astronaut. He showed great pride in his selection, and I congratulated him heartily. The results of the accident review board were hard to accept. The commission that investigated the accident blamed the Shuttle loss on poor management decisions. Challenger had been launched against the recommendations of knowledgeable technical personnel who insisted that low temperatures that day increased the chance of hot gas leakage around the seals of the solid rocket boosters. The commission found that the decision making process leading to the launch was flawed and that launch temperature constraints were waived at the expense of flight safety. It was a black day for NASA. I could sense a change in people\u0027s attitude concerning the space program. After the Challenger accident report was released, the public\u0027s pride in and respect for NASA diminished. At Dryden, we had always striven not to allow the desire to \"get a flight off\" to interfere with good judgment on flight safety. It was a cardinal rule. There were occasions when visiting Headquarters personnel and other VIPs were on hand to witness a test flight and we had to cancel the event due to some technical problem. We forced ourselves to avoid the desire to \"press on\" just to meet a schedule or impress a visiting VIP.\""},{"asinItemID":"B001P7GGRS","title":"The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Greene, Brian","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fVpAuurlL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Universe-Superstrings-Dimensions-ebook/dp/B001P7GGRS%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001P7GGRS","description":"\u003cp\u003eA new edition of the \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e bestseller—now a three-part \u003cem\u003eNova\u003c/em\u003e special: a fascinating and thought-provoking journey through the mysteries of space, time, and matter.\u003c/p\u003eNow with a new preface (not in any other edition) that will review the enormous public reception of the relatively obscure string theory—made possible by this book and an increased number of adherents amongst physicists—\u003cem\u003eThe Elegant Universe\u003c/em\u003e \"sets a standard that will be hard to beat\" (\u003cem\u003eNew York Times Book Review\u003c/em\u003e). Brian Greene, one of the world\u0027s leading string theorists, peels away the layers of mystery surrounding string theory to reveal a universe that consists of eleven dimensions, where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself, and all matter—from the smallest quarks to the most gargantuan supernovas—is generated by the vibrations of microscopically tiny loops of energy.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eToday physicists and mathematicians throughout the world are feverishly working on one of the most ambitious theories ever proposed: superstring theory. String theory, as it is often called, is the key to the Unified Field Theory that eluded Einstein for more than thirty years. Finally, the century-old antagonism between the large and the small-General Relativity and Quantum Theory-is resolved. String theory proclaims that all of the wondrous happenings in the universe, from the frantic dancing of subatomic quarks to the majestic swirling of heavenly galaxies, are reflections of one grand physical principle and manifestations of one single entity: microscopically tiny vibrating loops of energy, a billionth of a billionth the size of an atom. In this brilliantly articulated and refreshingly clear book, Greene relates the scientific story and the human struggle behind twentieth-century physics\u0027 search for a theory of everything.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThrough the masterful use of metaphor and analogy, \u003cem\u003eThe Elegant Universe\u003c/em\u003e makes some of the most sophisticated concepts ever contemplated viscerally accessible and thoroughly entertaining, bringing us closer than ever to understanding how the universe works."}]
