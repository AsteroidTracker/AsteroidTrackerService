Following in the footsteps of Christopher Hitchens, Roger Penrose,and even Stephen Hawking, Jim Holt emerges with an engrossing narrative thattraces our latest efforts to grasp the origins of the universe. As he takes onthe role of cosmological detective, the brilliant yet slyly humorous Holtcontends that we might have been too narrow in limiting our suspects to God vs.the Big Bang. Whether interviewing a cranky Oxford philosopher, a Physics NobelLaureate, or a French Buddhist monk, Holt pursues unexplored and often bizarreangles to this cosmic puzzle. The result is a brilliant synthesis of cosmology,mathematics, and physics—one that propels his own work to the level ofphilosophy itself."},{"asinItemID":"B00B9PTKSI","title":"Aliens in the Backyard - UFOs, Abductions, and Synchronicity","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"MacGregor, Trish","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510xu-vqMuL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Aliens-Backyard-Abductions-Synchronicity-ebook/dp/B00B9PTKSI%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00B9PTKSI","description":"Aliens in the Backyard:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUFO Encounters, Abductions, \u0026 Synchronicity\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn the early morning hours of March 28, 2011, Charles and Helene Fontaine experienced something that shattered their beliefs about the nature of reality.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne evening in 1981, Connie J Cannon was on I-75 with her young son, en route to their new home in Florida, when they suddenly found themselves on a military base, with a man in uniform holding a gun to her head as three Grays stood nearby.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn 1979, Diane Fine was on her way from upstate New York to Vermont to see an obstetrics specialist for her high risk pregnancy, and experienced two hours of missing time.

The last of these questions in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it’s the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God.
