Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human. How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you can’t walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, it’s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth. From the space shuttle training toilet to a crash test of NASA’s new space capsule (cadaver filling in for astronaut), Roach takes us on a surreally entertaining trip into the science of life in space and space on Earth."},{"asinItemID":"B004WY3D0O","title":"A Brief History of Time","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Hawking, Stephen","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rWHai4EUL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Time-ebook/dp/B004WY3D0O%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB004WY3D0O","description":"#1 \u003ci\u003eNEW YORK TIMES\u003c/i\u003e BESTSELLER\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA landmark volume in science writing by one of the great minds of our time, Stephen Hawking’s book explores such profound questions as: How did the universe begin—and what made its start possible?
