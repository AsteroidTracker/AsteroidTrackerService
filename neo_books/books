In \u003ci\u003eThe Universe Within,\u003c/i\u003e with his trademark clarity and exuberance, Shubin takes an even more expansive approach to the question of why we look the way we do. Starting once again with fossils, he turns his gaze skyward, showing us how the entirety of the universe’s fourteen-billion-year history can be seen in our bodies. As he moves from our very molecular composition (a result of stellar events at the origin of our solar system) through the workings of our eyes, Shubin makes clear how the evolution of the cosmos has profoundly marked our own bodies.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"asinItemID":"B007HXL016","title":"Why Does the World Exist?: An Existential Detective Story","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Holt, Jim","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51b2RCzJfLL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Why-Does-World-Exist-ebook/dp/B007HXL016%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB007HXL016","description":"\u003cp\u003eIn this astonishing and profound work, an irreverent sleuth traces the riddle of existence from the ancient world to modern times.\u003c/p\u003eWhether framedphilosophically as “Why is there a world rather than nothing at all?” or morecolloquially as “But, Mommy, who made God?” the metaphysical mystery about howwe came into existence remains the most fractious and fascinating question ofall time.
