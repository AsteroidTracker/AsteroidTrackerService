All of the mysteries physicists and cosmologists face—from the Big Bang to the future of the universe, from the puzzles of quantum physics to the unification of forces and particles—come down to the nature of time.\u003cBR\u003e\u003cBR\u003eThe fact that time is real may seem obvious. You experience it passing every day when you watch clocks tick, bread toast, and children grow. But most physicists, from Newton to Einstein to today’s quantum theorists, have seen things differently. The scientific case for time being an illusion is formidable. That is why the consequences of adopting the view that time is real are revolutionary.\u003cBR\u003e\u003cBR\u003eLee Smolin, author of the controversial bestseller \u003cI\u003eThe Trouble with Physics\u003c/I\u003e, argues that a limited notion of time is holding physics back.

The last of these questions in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it’s the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues—such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives.\u003cP\u003e \u003cP\u003eNow, in a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science \u003cI\u003eis \u003c/I\u003eaddressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results.

It will provoke, challenge, and delight readers as it looks at the most basic underpinnings of existence in a whole new way.

These included the giant delta-winged XB-70 supersonic research airplane, the wingless M2-F1 lifting body vehicle, and the triple-sonic YF-12 Blackbird. Mallick also test flew the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV) and helped develop techniques used in training astronauts to land on the Moon.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eExcerpt: \" I was onboard an airliner, on 28 January 1986, when I heard the news that the Space Shuttle Challenger had exploded 73 seconds after launch that morning. Even knowing the complexity and risk involved in Shuttle operations, I was shocked by the news. The shuttle commander, Dick Scobee, had been an Air Force test pilot at Edwards and flown a number of research missions at NASA Dryden. I grieved for all the crew, but especially Dick, who I knew best. I can still recall his broad grin when he visited the Dryden pilot\u0027s office following the announcement of his selection as an astronaut. He showed great pride in his selection, and I congratulated him heartily. The results of the accident review board were hard to accept. The commission that investigated the accident blamed the Shuttle loss on poor management decisions. Challenger had been launched against the recommendations of knowledgeable technical personnel who insisted that low temperatures that day increased the chance of hot gas leakage around the seals of the solid rocket boosters. The commission found that the decision making process leading to the launch was flawed and that launch temperature constraints were waived at the expense of flight safety. It was a black day for NASA. I could sense a change in people\u0027s attitude concerning the space program. After the Challenger accident report was released, the public\u0027s pride in and respect for NASA diminished. At Dryden, we had always striven not to allow the desire to \"get a flight off\" to interfere with good judgment on flight safety. It was a cardinal rule. There were occasions when visiting Headquarters personnel and other VIPs were on hand to witness a test flight and we had to cancel the event due to some technical problem. We forced ourselves to avoid the desire to \"press on\" just to meet a schedule or impress a visiting VIP.\""},{"asinItemID":"B005YMCBTC","title":"Neutrino","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Close, Frank","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oOZgmAFSL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Neutrino-ebook/dp/B005YMCBTC%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB005YMCBTC","description":"What are neutrinos? Why does nature need them? What use are they?Neutrinos are                perhaps the most enigmatic particles in the universe. Formed in certain radioactive                decays, they pass through most matter with ease. These tiny, ghostly particles are                formed in millions in the Sun and pass through us constantly. For a long time they                were thought to be massless, and passing as they do like ghosts they were not                regarded as significant. Now we know they have a very small mass, and there are                strong indications that they are very important indeed. It is speculated thata heavy                form of neutrino, that is both matter and antimatter, may have shaped the balance of                matter and antimatter in the early universe.Here, Frank Close gives an account of                the discovery of neutrinos and our growing understanding of their significance, also                touching on some speculative ideas concerning the possible uses of neutrinos and                their role in the early universe."}]
