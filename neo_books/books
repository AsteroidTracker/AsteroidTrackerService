The last of these questions in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it’s the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues—such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives.\u003cP\u003e \u003cP\u003eNow, in a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science \u003cI\u003eis \u003c/I\u003eaddressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in \u003cI\u003eA Universe from Nothing, \u003c/I\u003eand they suggest that not only \u003cI\u003ecan \u003c/I\u003esomething arise from nothing, something will \u003cI\u003ealways \u003c/I\u003earise from nothing.\u003cP\u003e \u003cP\u003eWith his characteristic wry humor and wonderfully clear explanations, Krauss takes us back to the beginning of the beginning\u003cI\u003e, \u003c/I\u003epresenting the most recent evidence for how our universe evolved—and the implications for how it’s going to end. It will provoke, challenge, and delight readers as it looks at the most basic underpinnings of existence in a whole new way. And this knowledge that our universe will be quite different in the future from today has profound implications and directly affects how we live in the present. As Richard Dawkins has described it: This could potentially be the most important scientific book with implications for supernaturalism since Darwin.\u003cP\u003e \u003cP\u003eA fascinating antidote to outmoded philosophical and religious thinking, \u003cI\u003eA Universe from Nothing \u003c/I\u003eis a provocative, game-changing entry into the debate about the existence of God and everything that exists. “Forget Jesus,” Krauss has argued, “the stars died so you could be born.”"},{"asinItemID":"B003Y56QYC","title":"Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void","productGroup":"Audible","author":"Mary Roach","imageUri":"","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Packing-Mars-Curious-Science-Life/dp/B003Y56QYC%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB003Y56QYC","description":" "},{"asinItemID":"B004WY3D0O","title":"A Brief History of Time","productGroup":"eBooks","author":"Hawking, Stephen","imageUri":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rWHai4EUL.jpg","detailPageUri":"http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Time-ebook/dp/B004WY3D0O%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJLOWSKG5QUEUFIPQ%26tag%3Dasteroi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB004WY3D0O","description":"#1 \u003ci\u003eNEW YORK TIMES\u003c/i\u003e BESTSELLER\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA landmark volume in science writing by one of the great minds of our time, Stephen Hawking’s book explores such profound questions as: How did the universe begin—and what made its start possible?
