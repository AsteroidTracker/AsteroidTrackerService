A lot of work by a lot of people has led up to this point,\" said John Kovac (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), leader of the BICEP2 collaboration.\"\n\nThat means we have some real, solid evidence that the Big Bang theory holds true and that the universe did break out in rapid early expansion as the theory predicts.
