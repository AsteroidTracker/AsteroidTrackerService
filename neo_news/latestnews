The program will pick 40 people for training and send the 1st 4-member team to Mars in 2023. \nThe team members, aside from dealing with an un-breathable carbon dioxide atmosphere and surface temperatures around -67 degrees F (-55 degrees C), will also have to agree to be a full-time, round the clock reality show visible on Earth. The show is supposed to help cover expenses for the mission. \nFull story from PHYS.ORG: http://phys.org/news/2013-09-space-cadets-line-one-way-mars.html","pubDate":"2013-Sep-11","imgURL":"http://24.media.tumblr.com/d75643cf2f08a6cba28aeb527c8cc248/tumblr_mswbrk5qoP1s52209o1_75sq.jpg","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/60941800390/did-you-sign-up-for-a-one-way-mission-to-mars","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5tumQXF6"},{"artcileUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/60934241500/a-tale-of-venus-and-the-moon-our-moon-appeared","description":"A tale of Venus and the moon - \nOur moon appeared in stellar cahoots with the planet Venus this weekend as the celestial bodies appeared in “conjunction,” which occurs when a pair of space objects appear next to each other from the perspective of Earth.\nFull story from SPACE.COM: http://www.space.com/22717-venus-moon-close-encounter-photos.html\nPhoto by Victor Rogus, taken near Jadwin Miss.","pubDate":"2013-Sep-11","imgURL":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/f7c7c547ca2db5e88139749e1ab71f67/tumblr_mswbgtaO4n1s52209o1_75sq.jpg","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/60934241500/a-tale-of-venus-and-the-moon-our-moon-appeared","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5tulzhpS"},{"artcileUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/60902672746/nasa-joins-instagram-you-read-that-right-nasa","description":"NASA joins instagram - \nYou read that right; NASA has launched an official account on Instagram, where the agency already has more than 100,000 followers and only 12 posts as of the wee hours of this morning. \nCheck out their feed!","pubDate":"2013-Sep-11","imgURL":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/02ad332d0c1184943d6480432e456ed2/tumblr_mswcmg0Djn1s52209o1_75sq.jpg","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/60902672746/nasa-joins-instagram-you-read-that-right-nasa","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5tuk5Gbg"},{"artcileUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/60844209405/a-flash-of-light-very-bright-fireball-over","description":"A flash of light - \n\nVery Bright Fireball Over the Northern Adriatic by Herman Mikuz, Crni Vrh Observatory, Slovenia\n\nvia kenobi-wan-obi:","pubDate":"2013-Sep-10","imgURL":"http://24.media.tumblr.com/9688210d291cfb46842d34eb4a47068e/tumblr_mstlr8lMBp1qbn5m1o2_75sq.gif","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/60844209405/a-flash-of-light-very-bright-fireball-over","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5tugcFJz"},{"artcileUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/60842237373/black-hole-hunter-scientists-have-already","description":"Black Hole Hunter - \nScientists have already “bagged” 10 supermassive black holes thanks to the NuStar program.
