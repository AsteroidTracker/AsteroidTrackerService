Among the naked-eye stars, it is the nearest of all, with the sole exception of Alpha Centauri. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the solar system, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to recede, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth’s sky for the next 210,000 years. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e","pubDate":"2013-Feb-26","imgURL":"http://24.media.tumblr.com/3e8173d3915f06af178d73eea2bbf6b9/tumblr_mircs1zUkZ1s52209o1_75sq.jpg","source":""},{"artcileUrl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130222.html","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePanorama from Mars!\u003c/strong\u003e The Mars Curiosity Rover took this panorama photo, capturing itself and its view on the Red Planet.  \u003c/p\u003e","pubDate":"2013-Feb-26","imgURL":"http://24.media.tumblr.com/d2522f831fc14ade8271b4d5b7af1a5c/tumblr_mirb56wTih1s52209o1_75sq.jpg","source":""},{"artcileUrl":"http://news.yahoo.com/super-space-germs-could-threaten-astronauts-212519361.html","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes space give germs super-powers? \u003c/strong\u003e No, not exactly, but it does allow common germs like Salmonella to become even more infectious than they are on Earth.
