This week NASA confirmed that Voyager 1 is in interstellar space, just on the edge of what we consider our solar system, speeding every further away from the area of space that’s influenced by our massive sun and it’s gravity. \nIn this video a series of scientists and science enthusiasts share their thoughts on humanity’s farthest reach yet into the great unknown. ","pubDate":"2013-Sep-13","imgURL":"http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/vDvWOkHN-9Y/hqdefault.jpg","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/61112501651/welcome-to-interstellar-space-humanitys","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5tuwbiMJ"},{"artcileUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/61092856698/corrected-what-everyone-got-wrong-about-voyager-1","description":"Corrected!

NASA spacecraft Voyager 1 has officially left the influence of our heliopause, putting it squarely in interstellar space, but the craft is still, technically IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.

DESPITE BEING 12 BILLION MILES AWAY IT IS STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE SUN’S GRAVITY. \nThe 36-year-old spacecraft is, however, officially in interstellar space, slowly creeping away from the sun’s influence.
