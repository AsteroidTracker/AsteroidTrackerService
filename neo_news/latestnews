Zoom through a galaxy, and every single one of the millions of points of light streaming past is a star with potentially many planets and moons of its own. Zoom out far enough, and now the points of light are galaxies. Space Engine uses real scientific data and imagery where available (for our solar system and for known galaxies, stars, and exoplanets) and procedural generation elsewhere, and if you have a powerful enough computer and crank up the settings you can easily get views that look like they could have come from Hubble. Even on my relatively old PC I’ve been moved to tears by how beautiful it can be.\"\n\n\nMore info and download links: http://en.spaceengine.org/forum/20-1945-1","pubDate":"2013-12-28","imgURL":"http://24.media.tumblr.com/47f1a3304a9c1ba4cb1c7d30f1f933ed/tumblr_mygdfiadQ41s52209o1_75sq.jpg","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/71429019549/more-than-a-game-zoom-through-the-universe-with","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5t12XW5UT"},{"artcileUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/71345196131/a-postcard-from-the-moon-the-chinese-yutu","description":"A postcard from the moon - \nThe Chinese Yutu lunar probe sent home a panoramic view of its landing site, which others were able to turn into this image by sewing together images cut from a news video. \nMore from Universe Today: http://www.universetoday.com/107388/chinas-1st-lunar-lander-snaps-1st-landing-site-panorama/#ixzz2obTVe9km","pubDate":"2013-12-27","imgURL":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/7701235873159c3c5e8abd72f7ad5534/tumblr_mygcqw4asm1s52209o1_75sq.jpg","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/71345196131/a-postcard-from-the-moon-the-chinese-yutu","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5t12SWKnZ"},{"artcileUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/71323538046/the-many-faces-of-the-sun-against-a-base","description":"The many faces of the sun - \n\n\"Against a base image made at a visible wavelengths, the wedge-shaped segments show the solar disk at increasingly shorter ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet wavelengths.
