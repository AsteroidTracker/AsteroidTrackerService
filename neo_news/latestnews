New research seems to support the notion that an icy traveler from the sky crashed on Earth and left behind the essential components of living organisms. They learned this by shooting things out of a high-powered steel-cannon. \nWhen icy comets or meteorites crash onto planets, they apparently form all kinds of amino acids, the so-called building blocks of life. The trick is to crash into a planet with the conditions to help life along a bit. \n\n\"The team made their discovery by recreating the impact of a comet by firing projectiles through a large high speed gun. This gun, located at the University of Kent, uses compressed gas to propel projectiles at speeds of 7.15 kilometres per second into targets of ice mixtures, which have a similar composition to comets. The resulting impact created amino acids such as glycine and D-and L-alanine.\"\n\nMore from PHYS.ORG: http://phys.org/news/2013-09-scientists-cosmic-factory-blocks-life.html","pubDate":"2013-Sep-16","imgURL":"http://25.media.tumblr.com/90f0eacdc45cef318416f17fde5dbce2/tumblr_mt7bj7Mjg01s52209o1_75sq.jpg","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/61412877331/more-evidence-that-life-on-earth-came-from-the","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5tvCVYGJ"},{"artcileUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/61399119042/cosmic-death-the-wings-in-this-photo-are","description":"Cosmic death - \nThe “wings” in this photo are created by a dying star forming a planetary nebula, named M2-9, which is 2,100 light-years away.
