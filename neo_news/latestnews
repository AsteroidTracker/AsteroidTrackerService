Zoom through a galaxy, and every single one of the millions of points of light streaming past is a star with potentially many planets and moons of its own. Zoom out far enough, and now the points of light are galaxies. Space Engine uses real scientific data and imagery where available (for our solar system and for known galaxies, stars, and exoplanets) and procedural generation elsewhere, and if you have a powerful enough computer and crank up the settings you can easily get views that look like they could have come from Hubble.
