The Cassini spacecraft recently caught glimpses of “water ice” dredged up from deep within Saturn’s atmosphere, the first time we’ve actually detected water ice is Saturn’s atmosphere!\n\n\"The new finding from Cassini shows that Saturn can dredge up material from more than 100 miles [160 kilometers],\" said Kevin Baines, a co-author of the paper who works at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"It demonstrates in a very real sense that typically demure-looking Saturn can be just as explosive or even more so than typically stormy Jupiter.\"\n\nA close-up of the storm: \n\nFull story from NASA.GOV: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release\u003d2013-268","pubDate":"2013-Sep-05","imgURL":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/78b5743f76ce012ba6433f8d7a11b09b/tumblr_mskkhig2DZ1s52209o1_r1_75sq.jpg","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/60314215145/makin-it-hail-on-saturn-cassini-finds-1st","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5tuB0UBf"},{"artcileUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/60299524487/an-explorer-far-from-home-the-dawn-spacecraft","description":"An explorer far from home - \nThe Dawn spacecraft is making the rounds to 2 of the largest objects in the asteroid belt.
