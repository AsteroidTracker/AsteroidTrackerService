But what does it mean?\nScientists studying the the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which is the left-over radiation from the Big Bang, have detected for the first time gravitational waves or swirls that support the theory of Cosmic Inflation.  \n\n\"Detecting this signal is one of the most important goals in cosmology today. A lot of work by a lot of people has led up to this point,\" said John Kovac (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), leader of the BICEP2 collaboration.\"\n\nThat means we have some real, solid evidence that the Big Bang theory holds true and that the universe did break out in rapid early expansion as the theory predicts. It’s also another example where scientists used math to predict something about nature, went out and tested nature and discovered that the math led them on the right path. \nFull Story: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140317125850.htm\n(Image: Astronomy Picture of the Day: http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1403/DSLmap_BICEP2_3888.jpg)","pubDate":"2014-03-19","imgURL":"http://24.media.tumblr.com/5dfe8f94413b78bfac58272a0cfd6a9c/tumblr_n2ogruCQfC1s52209o1_r1_75sq.jpg","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/80097135441/gravity-waves-found-but-what-does-it-mean","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5t1AcAKjH"},{"artcileUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003d2WRgXvdasm0","description":"Our Sun - \nA time-lapse video of our Sun for the month of January 2014.  All the imaging is from NASA’s Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). \n\nAstronomy Picture of the Day: http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140312.html","pubDate":"2014-03-15","imgURL":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/2WRgXvdasm0/hqdefault.jpg","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/79687950418/our-sun-a-time-lapse-video-of-our-sun-for-the","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5t1ADnQ1I"},{"artcileUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/79567155327/happy-pi-day-art-by-chris-leavens","description":"Happy Pi Day! \nArt by Chris Leavens, http://www.unloosen.com/thestuff/archives/2007/10/iad_13_get_more_pie_by_chris_l.html)\nFinding space-themed pie/pi art wasn’t as easy as we’d imagined it would be.
