The rover’s going to climb a nearby hill to a point where its solar panels will be better positioned to capture the scarce winter sunlight, but it’s got some time to kill. \nIn the meantime, the rover’s taking a closer look at a geological formation near Solander Point where two rock layers have come together. Some of the minerals found there may have been formed in a much wetter environment than exists there now. \nMore from NASA.GOV: http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20130814a.html\n ","pubDate":"2013-Sep-23","imgURL":"http://25.media.tumblr.com/9244e0b19dd4fc39d0a7d2a383e7d364/tumblr_mtgz68MDDS1s52209o1_75sq.jpg","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/62076788661/veteran-mars-rover-opportunity-braces-itself","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5tvq49_r"},{"artcileUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/62007182664/makers-unite-for-nasa-for-the-first-time-in","description":"Makers unite for NASA! \nFor the first time in history, NASA is inviting the public, from private industries to private citizens, to help in developing ways to protect the Earth from asteroids and further the space program. \n\n\"These partnerships represent a new way of doing business for NASA and a call to action for Makers: join us to become a critical part of the future of space exploration.\"\n\nMore from NASA.COM: http://www.nasa.gov/press/2013/september/nasa-highlights-asteroid-grand-challenge-at-world-maker-faire/#.Uj5yQIasiSo","pubDate":"2013-Sep-22","imgURL":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/1bf142c7938ad84c4de7aca985c647e0/tumblr_mtif3zV5ag1s52209o1_75sq.jpg","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/62007182664/makers-unite-for-nasa-for-the-first-time-in","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5tvlweL8"},{"artcileUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/61984362501/sneaky-comet-don-quixote-finally-revealed","description":"Sneaky comet Don Quixote finally revealed - \nOddball space-rock 3552 Don Quixote, long believed to be an asteroid, was ultimately found out to be a comet, despite having an orbit that led many astronomers to classify it otherwise. \n3552 Don Quixote is the 3rd largest known near-Earth object, with a diameter of about 12 miles (19 km). \nMore from ABC.NET.AU: http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2013/09/17/3848461.htm","pubDate":"2013-Sep-22","imgURL":"http://25.media.tumblr.com/303c8fa6514e90c2ef5b72fb842cd011/tumblr_mtiercvTUc1s52209o1_75sq.jpg","source":"","tumblrUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/61984362501/sneaky-comet-don-quixote-finally-revealed","shortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJUz5tvkZb05"},{"artcileUrl":"http://spacetracks.tumblr.com/post/61968037380/want-to-be-nasas-guinea-pig-study-pays-18k-for","description":"Want to be NASA’s guinea pig?
